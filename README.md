# Blog Application
Amsterdam Eats is a NodeJS blog application I created during Week 10 of the NYCDA JavaScript Intensive program. The blog is pretty straight forward: you can sign up to become a member, or login if you have an existing account. After you're in the platform, you can view your profile and create blog posts pertaining to great places to eat in Amsterdam. Once you've created a post, it will appear on the "Entries" section where other users can click and comment on your writings. The blog application also gives you the ability to view other users, see what they have posted, and comment on their posts as well!
